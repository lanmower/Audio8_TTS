//! CUDA graph capture/replay for the fixed-shape T=1 decode step, matching
//! what "the decode step" means architecturally in rust_runtime/src/runtime.rs's
//! slow_step_graph/fast_step_graph: after an initial variable-length prefill,
//! every subsequent slow_step call is a single new token against a growing
//! KV cache, and every fast_step call is a single codebook position - both
//! fixed-shape, address-stable-buffer operations that are exactly what CUDA
//! graph capture targets.
//!
//! Uses cudarc's safe CudaStream::begin_capture for capture start (candle-core
//! re-exports cudarc at the same 0.19.8 pin candle itself is built against,
//! so no separate cudarc dependency/version-mismatch risk), but end_capture/
//! instantiate/launch are done via raw driver FFI (sys::cuStreamEndCapture,
//! sys::cuGraphInstantiateWithFlags with flags=0, sys::cuGraphLaunch) rather
//! than cudarc's own CudaStream::end_capture/CudaGraph::launch, because
//! cudarc's safe wrapper only accepts sys::CUgraphInstantiate_flags - an enum
//! with no zero/no-flags variant - and flags=0 (no AUTO_FREE_ON_LAUNCH) is
//! required for correctness here (see INSTANTIATE_FLAGS doc below). This is
//! the same underlying API mistral.rs's own CudaGraphHandle
//! (mistralrs-core/src/pipeline/cuda_graph.rs:737-814) wraps by hand, just
//! with a different flags value.
//!
//! CALLER REQUIREMENT: disable cudarc's per-slice event tracking
//! (`unsafe { device.as_cuda_device()?.cuda_stream().context().disable_event_tracking() }`)
//! immediately after creating the CUDA device and BEFORE loading any model
//! weights or other tensors - not just around the capture window. cudarc's
//! CudaSlice::Drop calls stream.wait(event) for any slice whose read/write
//! CudaEvent was populated at allocation time; a weight tensor (or RoPE
//! table, or anything else) allocated while tracking was still on keeps
//! that populated event for its whole lifetime, and dropping an
//! intermediate view/tensor derived from it DURING capture reproducibly
//! corrupted the captured graph (cuGraphLaunch failing with
//! CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS, reliably reproducible even for a single
//! transformer layer's intermediates - bisected via
//! src/bin/graph_smoke_test.rs and src/bin/decode_graph_bench.rs's
//! ARKTTS_DEBUG_N_LAYERS support). Toggling tracking off only for the
//! begin_capture/end_capture window is insufficient since it does not
//! retroactively clear already-populated events on already-allocated
//! tensors.
