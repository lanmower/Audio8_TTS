//! candle-weight-repacking-quantization
//!
//! Reads the FP32 weights dequantized from ONNX's GatherBlockQuantized /
//! MatMulNBits blocks (candle_runtime/weights/{slow_ar,fast_ar}_fp32.npz,
//! produced by onnx-to-candle-weight-extraction /
//! candle_runtime/scripts/extract_onnx_weights.py) and repacks them into
//! candle's own QTensor block-quantization format, persisted as a .gguf file
//! per graph (candle's native on-disk quantized-tensor format, written via
//! candle_core::quantized::gguf_file::write).
//!
//! DECISION: dequantize-then-requantize, NOT a direct bit-for-bit repack.
//! Established live (see extract_onnx_weights.py's docstring + this
//! session's research) that ONNX's MatMulNBits/GatherBlockQuantized layout
//! and candle's Q4_0 layout are incompatible at three independent levels:
//!   1. Block size: ONNX MatMulNBits uses block_size=128 (per its own node
//!      attributes, verified live); candle's GgmlDType::Q4_0 hardcodes
//!      block_size=32 (QK4_0 constant, candle-core/src/quantized/k_quants.rs).
//!   2. Quantization scheme: ONNX uses affine (asymmetric) quantization with
//!      an explicit per-block zero_point input; candle's Q4_0 is symmetric
//!      only (scale d = amax/-8, dequant = (nibble-8)*d, no zero-point field
//!      in BlockQ4_0 at all).
//!   3. Nibble packing order: ONNX Runtime's own RTN packer
//!      (matmul_nbits_quantizer.py's pack_int8_to_int4) packs ADJACENT PAIRS
//!      (element i -> low nibble, i+1 -> high nibble); candle's BlockQ4_0
//!      packs SPLIT HALVES (element j -> low nibble of qs[j], element j+16
//!      -> high nibble of the same byte, for a 32-element block).
//! Any one of these would already block a direct repack; all three together
//! make it definitively infeasible without emulating ONNX's exact affine
//! block-128 scheme as a brand new custom candle quantization type (far
//! higher risk/cost for a preview model than accepting FP16-order requant
//! error). Dequantizing to FP32 (already done, extraction step) and calling
//! candle's own QTensor::quantize(&tensor, GgmlDType::Q4_0) is the correct,
//! low-risk path: candle re-derives its own scale/zero-point/packing
//! natively, guaranteeing internal consistency with candle's own dequant
//! kernels at inference time (the only thing that matters for correctness -
//! bit-parity with ONNX's specific quantization choice was never a
//! requirement, only "coherent, close" per this PRD row's own postcondition
//! and the sibling port-slow-fast-ar-to-candle row's postcondition).
//! Precision tradeoff: two lossy int4 quantization passes now compose
//! (original ONNX RTN quant -> our FP32 dequant, exact -> candle Q4_0 requant,
//! lossy) instead of one. Q4_0's block size is 4x smaller than ONNX's
//! (32 vs 128), which partially COMPENSATES by giving candle's requant finer
//! granularity (each candle block sees less dynamic range to cover with one
//! scale) - the two effects partially offset. This is accepted as the right
//! tradeoff for a research/preview port; verified numerically below.
//!
//! Which tensors get quantized: only the actual nn.Linear-equivalent 2D
//! weight matrices that were originally MatMulNBits/GatherBlockQuantized in
//! ONNX (wqkv, wo, w1/w2/w3, fast_output, lm_head, embeddings,
//! codebook_embeddings, fast_embeddings) - RMSNorm weights and biases (1D,
//! small, and precision-sensitive for norm stability) are kept as plain F32
//! QTensor-wrapped-as-F32 (GgmlDType::F32), matching how the ONNX graphs
//! themselves left them unquantized.
